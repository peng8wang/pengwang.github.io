Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Professor Anthony Man-Cho So](http://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~manchoso). My research interests mainly lie in optimization theory and algorithms for nonconvex optimization and their applications in machine learning, statistics and information sciences.
